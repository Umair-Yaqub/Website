		Inspirational story of the popular K-pop band: BTS
		
	</center></font>

	<font face="Segoe UI Light" size="5"><p><big>

		
		In the last few years BTS (Bangtan Boys) has become one of the largest known bands in the world. Their rise to popularity in recent years is nothing short of a 
		miracle, especially considering they are based in South Korea and majority of their lyrics are in the Korean language. The fact that a 7-member boy-band, whose 
		primary language is not English, has managed to gain such popularity in the western world is nothing short of revolutionary.

		In the span of their short career, the BTS group has received 6 American Music Awards, 9 Billboard Music Awards, 24 Golden Disk Awards, and a nomination for a Grammy 
		Award and a Brit Award. In 2017, BTS branched into the global music market leading the Korean Wave in the United States while breaking numerous records.
